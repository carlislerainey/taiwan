Manuscript, code, and data for "Does District Magnitude Matter? The Case of Taiwan." [[Paper](http://www.carlislerainey.com/files/taiwan.pdf)]

> A sizable literature on electoral institutions argues that proportional electoral rules lead to higher voter turnout. However, recent work finds little evidence that the effect generalizes beyond western Europe and the theoretical arguments remain sparse, incomplete, and contradictory. I use a well-chosen data set to resolve problems of omitted variable bias and Bayesian model averaging to address model uncertainty and evaluate evidence both for and against the null hypotheses. I find evidence that the proportionality of electoral rules exerts no meaningful effect on turnout or the any of the theoretical mechanisms I test.

To replicate these results, you can use Git to clone this repository or download it as a `.zip` archive. The original CSES data set is too large to host in a GitHub repository, so you need to create a subdirectory called `data`, download [this `.zip` file](http://www.cses.org/datacenter/module2/data/cses2.zip) and unzip it, and move the file `cses2_rawdata.txt` into `data` subdirectory. Once you do this, you can replicate all the results by simply setting the project directory (i.e., `taiwan`) as R's working directory and running the script `do-all.R`. This takes just a couple of minutes. Note that the `do-all.R` script creates a new subdirectories `output`, `doc/figs`, and `doc/tabs` that store all the R output, tables, and figures, respectively.
