	Question: Does increased political efficacy explain higher political
	participation in PR systems? Goal: Explain higher participation in
	PR systems. Theory: This paper proposes four effects of systems on
	the decision to vote. (1) Plurality systems, through disproportionality,
	discourage supporters of minor parties (a loss of efficacy) and depress
	their participation. Parties might alter their own behavior for a
	similar reason. (2) A greater number of parties increases the likelihood
	of a coalition government, which depresses participation, and increases
	participation by allowing more parties to mobilize and attract voters.
	(3) Parties are more likely to adopt distinct ideological positions
	under PR rules. In systems with extreme parties, voters will adopt
	stronger partisan attachment. (4) These effects varies depending
	on the party the voter is attracted to. Large party supporters are
	not discouraged from voting in plurality systems. Concepts: Nothing
	new here. Unit of analysis: Individual Actors: Individuals making
	the decision, and elites choosing the extent of mobilization Implications:
	Seem to directly test the theory, although they test the mechanism
	(efficacy). DV(s): efficacy, turnout decision IV(s):Effective number
	of parties, parties in government, preference for small party, disproportionality,
	strength of preference, efficacy (all of these variables have an
	indirect effect through efficacy and all but preference for small
	party have a direct effect as well).
	
	METHODOLOGICAL
	
	Implications tested: (1) The number of parties in government has a
	negative effect on efficacy. (2) The number of effective parties
	in parliament has a postive effect on efficacy and participation.
	(3) The strength of party preference has a positive effect on efficacy.
	Empirical strategy: Multilevel models Test adequacy: Seems to work.
	Measurement validity: OK Case selection: CSES
	
	FINDINGS
	
	1.) Citizens who prefer small parties exhibit less efficacy. These
	effect incease as the system become more disproportional. 2.) Strength
	of party preference positively effects efficacy and voting. 3.) Number
	of parties in goverment negatively effects efficacy.

@article{Selb2009,
	Annote = {SUBSTANTIVE
	
	Question: Does increased competition lead to greater participation
	in PR systems? Goal: Explain why we observe higher turnout in PR
	systems. Theory: Borrows from Cox (1999), the "pivotal elites model."
	Parties observe that resources are well-spent in some districts,
	but "wasted" in others. This leads to great variation in the mobilization
	efforts of parties acorss districts in SMD systems. PR systems on
	the other hand are competed for in larger districts, giving parties
	the incentive to mobilize all citizens. Concepts: Nothing to deep
	here Unit of analysis: District Actors: parties and citizens who
	respond Implications: higher turnout in more competitive districts,
	greater variation in turnout across districts in SMD systems. DV:
	turnout, district level IV(s): threshold of exclusion, district margin
	
	METHODOLOGICAL
	
	Implications tested: (1) Greater turnout in closer elections, (2)
	mobilization and turnout more variable in SMD systems, (3) no difference
	between PR and SMD, competitiveness held constant, (4) ower turnout
	with higher threshold of exclusion, and (5-7) suprdistrict corrections
	produce higher turnout, weaker effect of competitiveness, lower cross-district
	variation. Empirical strategy: Mixed Heteroskedastic Logit. It seems
	that given lower turnout in SMD systems, the variation cannot help
	but be greater. It seems that the structure of the systems themselves
	might be producing these results. It seems like he could have the
	causal arrow backward. Test adequecy: I don't know enough about this
	model to say. Measurement validity: I am not sure that his construct
	of district competitiveness makes much sense. I need to at least
	think about this some more. Case selection: CSES data
	
	FINDINGS
	
	The observed difference in turnout is due to local competition.
